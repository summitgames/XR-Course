### Workshop Session Notes...

**Below is a quick guide and topics that are fundamental to organise a workshop and hackahton for XR Students.**


1. XR terminologies and AR | VR and MR.


* - History & Emerging Technologies Storyline.

* - What is AR and supportive technologies

* - What is VR and supportive technologies


2. Similarity and Differences.

3. Hardware that are deployed for XR (Mobile for AR | HMD for VR and Optical see through HMD for MR).

4. Industry Examples and how people are adopting the technology.

5. Current Stage and Challenges and Hardware Constraints.

6. Software Tech Stacks (Oculus, HTC Vive, Open XR) -> VR

7. Unity, Unreal as software engine platforms.

8. ARFoundation, ARCore, ARKit, Vuforia, OpenCV, tensorflow, etc for AR Based Software SDK

9. MagicLean and Mircosoft has their SDK embedded in the engine. UWP Platform is deployment.

10. What do Content and Production means for XR.

11. Technological Advancements of XR.

12. Disucssed Why AR Still 10 Years Away ?

13. Which are the Industries adopting XR technology and how.(relative usecase for each in detail will be explained today)

14. XR Companies in India and top 10 in the world.

15. Exosystem of AI | 5G | MachineLearning | CV | IOT as as XR Ecosystem tech stacks.

16. How to aspire to be a XR Developer or get into this industry. (Computer Science | Art | VFX or Graphic Design)

17. Understanding AR | VR as a platform or a technology or experience or as a bussiness Solution.
Example: 

* - Difference between XR as content and technology and business use-cases and industry dependence.
* - Content as VFX(mocap and virtual sets, realtime)
* - Content as 360 
* - Content as Audio 360 or Binaurual
* - Content as 3D immersive

18. Content is also produced using AR and VR technology like Spatial Computing.(like 3D Volumetric Video, automated scanned Photogrammetry models).

19. Enterprise (it was Question) - All Industry based on thier use-case are switching over to XR and relative bussiness ventures.

20. The curve and Industry transformation (that is been seen and analysed)

- Education Courses and Computer Science Degrees are adding XR as their subjects.
- VFX, Graphics and Design Industry have been adopting XR terminoloogies and creating content. There are specific Courses designed for it.
- Gaming as a profession has moved or included with XR as the base which includes Unity and Unreal Engine.

21. Computer Vision Terminology

* Computer Vision and Camera Processing(pixel) or (light)
* - Hand Gesture and Voice Pattern Recongition
* - Object Detection
* - Image Pattern Recognition
* - Image Segmentation
* - Image Labelling
* - Facial Recognition
* - Image , Color, sorrounding Segmentation and Recognition
* - Body Recognition
* - Environment Occlusion and Surfacing (SLAM)
* - Hand Gesture and Voice Pattern Recongition

22. Spatial Computing

23. Motion Capture Systems

* - How VFX uses Motion Capture for Animations and Films.
