## How to Submit a Pull Request

- If you are at this stage, you are ready to make your contribution. So let's talk about how to actually submit a pull request.

### Steps to Submit a PR

* Fork the repository

-  At the top right corner, you will see the term "fork". All you need to do is click it and you will have created a copy of the same project in your account.


After this operation the URL of the project will change to:

https://github.com/summitgames/XR-Course


* Clone the project into your local machine.

- Copy the forked project URL, and proceed to your local machine where you will open git bash, and proceed with the command below:

`git clone https://github.com/summitgames/XR-Course`


This will create a copy of the project on your local machine. Now that you have cloned the repo we will need to do two things:


First is to make the necessary changes/contribution and commit those changes. After making your changes and adding new files, its time to add those changes into a separate branch before pushing them to remote.


But, first let's create a branch. In your git bash, change the path to pint to your repository directory. To do that use this command:

`cd project folder name`

Now, to create a branch we will use the command: git checkout


`git checkout -b your-new-branch-name`


It's time to add the new changes into the branch we created. In order to see all the changes you made, we will use the git status command:


`git status`


The command will list all the changes you made. To add them we will use "git add *", which will add all the files to our branch.*


`git add *`

Let's add a commit message, briefly explaining what we added:

`git commit -m "<message here>"`


- Push changes to remote.


Now that everything is set, it's time to let our maintainer know what we have added. That is made possible by pushing the changes with this command:

`git push origin <add-your-branch-name>`


replacing <add-your-branch-name> with the name of the branch you created earlier, in my case it will be git push origin larykmak.


- Submit changes


*  If you go to your repository on GitHub and refresh the page, you'll see a Compare and pull request button. Click on that button.

Soon the maintainer will merge all your changes into the master branch of this project (unless they need changes from you). You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.


Creating a pull request has some advantages, like:

* It allows you to contribute to another repo without needing administrative privileges to make changes to the repo.

* It allows others to review your changes and suggest corrections, additions, edits, and so on.

* It gives repo administrators control over what gets added to their project repo.


**Congratulations ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰**


You just completed the standard fork -> clone -> edit -> pull request work-flow which sums up to your first contribution. You'll use this often as a contributor! So, what next?


In order for you to perform this step, you must have Git installed locally in your machine. If you don't, refer to the official Git docs on how to get started.


Further details will be added to this document.


Thanks you.
