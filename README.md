## Introduction

- The contributors of this project looks forward to create a centralised open source robust XR eco-system for the Educational Institues, Training Centres, Enterprises and Startups.

- This course is designed for universities who are adopting XR technology and front-end technologies in thier curriculum and offering masters or graduate programme.

- The course also bookmarks all the available online courses on udemy, Books, Youtube channels and other educational web portals that are related to the AR | VR - XR Industry.

- There is a lot of hidden treasure lying across pages scattered across the internet. This list is an attempt to bring to light those awesome courses, materials which make their high-quality material including i.e. workshop, AR-VR Lab, assignments, lectures, notes, readings & examinations available online for free.


## Purpose | AIM | Goal

* Open Source Guides are a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project.

## For Whom

* The information is available for students, proffessors, eduactional institues, Universities, Online Courses and technology enthusiasts in the XR Industry.

### Background

The Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality collective as Extended Reality Technology terms were not known to many and learning programme in the Universities and Educational Institues wasn't available until the year of 2015.

The front-tech technologies were inter-dependent on several other industries such as Gaming, VFX & Animations, hardware technologies such as digital displays, camera sensors, motion sensors, micro-controllers, etc and software technology layers Computer Vision, Computer Graphics.

The Software suites such as Unity, Unreal were the base software platform to create VR Experiences. The SDK Tools such as Oculus, VIVE, Open XR and Web VR for VR and Qualcomm's Vufroia, Google's ArCore, Apple's ARKit, Google Tango, OpenCV, Unity ARFoundation software framework formed as an eco-system.

The above tools, software development and technological stack formed XR as an eco-system which was highly distributed and didn't have a centralised learning course or process and platform for advanced learning in this subject. Therefore, it was a immediate need for many educational universities and institutions to structure/form a specially designed course where formal training, learning and certifications could be given to students.

The emerging technologies were certain to create a huge pool of requirements and support the eco-system. As adoptation of XR technology in enterprises and consumer eco-system were fast penetrating and many innovative business solutions were focusing on XR Technology. Training and Educational Institues looked forward for exprertise and guidance from industry professionals, pioneers who could support and draft/formalise such a XR course who could bridge a base model for XR entusiasts to advance in the industry.

There are 1000's of patents evolving in the XR Industry in the last few years and businesses are looking to adopt XR technology for the future.

The educational institues are looking forward to offer students in graduate/masters programme as a specially designed course-subject to enroll and form as a their career.

Naturally, as requirements in the industry, fast-growth and future potential of emerging technologies created a huge demand for skilled workforce to cater the advancements of technology, The educational institues are prepped and ready to set-up the foundation to offer such programmes.
