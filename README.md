  As the adoption of XR technology in enterprises and consumer eco-system is fast penetrating and innovative business solutions were focusing on XR Technology. Training and Educational Institutes looked forward to expertise and guidance from industry professionals, Emerging Technology pioneers who could support and formalize such an XR knowledge Hub where it would provide a complete package, one-stop learning material and latest (current) upto-date information. These resources in the project are carefully organized and curated offering a study syllabus, designed courses, learning materials, conducting workshops, setting up AR-VR Lab, assignments, events, industry insights, course books on subjects like AR, and VR.

## Vision

* The Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality collective as Extended Reality Technology (also called Metaverse) terms were not known to many and learning programme in the Universities and Educational Institues wasn't available until the year of 2015. One reason we have started this open project is because we felt that there weren't enough educational resources and materials as a centralised learning process and platform to educate, learn, guide as it evolves for advanced learning in this subject. 

* The front-tech technologies were inter-dependent on several other industries such as Gaming, VFX & Animations, hardware technologies such as digital displays, camera sensors, motion sensors, micro-controllers, etc and software technology layers Computer Vision, Computer Graphics.

* There is a lot of hidden treasure lying across pages scattered across the internet. This project is an attempt to bring to light everything which makes our platform as an Eco-system. This project intially started with offering AR-VR Course and have extended and not limited to others such as conducting workshop, setting up AR-VR Lab, Training Centres, Practicals/Assignments, Recruitment Assesments, Guidance on conducting Lectures, examinations, etc.

* Additionally, We also bring forward other verticals (sharing knowledge/guidelines/curate learning materials) which formulates XR, such as software tools, development SDK, Gaming Engines, Hardware Technologies, Virtual Production, VFX Advancements, Industry Patents, Learning Course Content, Online Materials, Expo & Events, Industry Insights, Corporates/Enterprises in XR, 360 Video Production, XR Open Source Projects, XR Innovative Use-cases and Industry Adoption as defined below as "Scope" for our platform and initative.

* The information is available for students, proffessors, trainers, innovators, scientists, educational institutes, Universities, Online Courses, Youtube Channels Creators and technology enthusiasts, VFX Artists, Designers, Creators in the XR Industry.

## Technologies

**"The XR Technology is evolved with underlying software and hardware tech stacks such as Computer Graphics, Computer Vision."**


* The Software suites such as Unity, Unreal were the base software platform to create VR Experiences. The SDK Tools such as Oculus, VIVE, Open XR and Web VR for VR and Qualcomm's Vuforia, Google's ArCore, Apple's ARKit, Google Tango, OpenCV, Unity ARFoundation software framework formed as an eco-system. There are 1000's of patents evolving in the XR Industry in the last few years and businesses are looking to adopt XR technology for the future.
